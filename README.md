> _I travel with my patterns._

Design systems are all about clearly giving identity to observed patterns.

~First, I am trying to see how fast I can deploy a Storybook to GitHub Pages.~ Then I might make some patterns.

### Update: 8 days after creating repo

Deploying a Storybook to GitHub Pages was amazingly fast and painless. Iâ€™m still not sold on alternatives like [Styleguideist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org) or [Catalog](http://catalog.style).

Still thinking about this, but very limited time to do have completed anything meaningful. Went on a couple tangents with [Universal Rendering](http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp/docs/guides/universal-rendering.html), [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io), [Expo XDE](https://expo.io), [Max Stoiberâ€™s post](https://medium.com/styled-components/announcing-primitives-support-for-truly-universal-component-systems-5772c7d14bc7), and [this MLS post](https://hackernoon.com/up-and-running-with-universal-components-66678132cad) which are all relevant to what I want to accomplish with my patterns.

As stated previously, I _might_ make some patterns. Need help getting over the hump.

### Update: day after Christmas

![28 days later](https://www.spookyisles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/28-Days-Later-scene.jpg)

After many hours of tinkering over the past several weeks, I am giving up on a [monorepo](https://hackernoon.com/up-and-running-with-universal-components-66678132cad) until either [react-primitives](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-primitives/issues) supports react-dom or [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) supports [react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp). Until then, Iâ€™ll be coding components for Sketch that I probably wonâ€™t render to the web unless I figure out something clever.

Stillâ€¦ 2017 was awesome for React as a Platform, tho. ðŸ”¥
